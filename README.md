# Python Neural Network Tweet Classifier
Python Neural Network which Classifes Tweets between Negative and Positive sentiments.

Made after following the book, Neural Networks from Scratch by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela

## Generating Data
### Random Generation
Random generation is done by querying the twitter API with a random search term out of currently 55 different terms. The user then can assign the tweet as Positive or Negative, skip the tweet, or stop the generation which will save all tweets that were assigned. Retweets are skipped.

This is done by running twitter_data_by_random.py

### ID Generation
ID generation is done by querying the twitter API with a select tweet ID. A tweet ID is the final piece of its URL. The user then can assign the tweet as Positive or Negative, skip the tweet. Retweets are disallowed as they do not provide good data.

This is done by running twitter_data_by_id.py

## Running the Model
The model is run in main.py. The program will preprocess the data generated by the previous steps. After preprocessing, a training datasets is generated out of the tweet data. The Model will run, and then ask to predict a tweet. Inputting a tweet's ID will allow the Model to do so.

The more tweets provided, the more accurate the model will be.
